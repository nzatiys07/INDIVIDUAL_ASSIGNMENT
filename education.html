	<blockquote><h3 p style="font-family: britannc bold; background-color: lightgrey; font-size: 20px; color: black;"><center>Starting from my preschool, I get my first education in Tadika Kemas Ampang. It's not too far from my house and about 2km only. I went to the preschool by school bus because my mom and father are going to their work early in the morning. It's a great experience for me to feel the feeling to go to the school by bus as nowadays there's only school van. Next, I went to elemntary school in SK Tasek Permai then went to SMK Tasek Permai. I graduated in SPM there. SMK Tasek Permai is famous for their beautiful and even achieve reward of beautiful school in Ampang. Not gonna lie, this school is pretty and the environment is so calming. It's far from the noise and city. It's up on the hill so we can see the view of Ampang from the school. Lastly, in this current moment, I pursue my study in UiTM Machang, Kelantan. I only get to be here in my last sem because of Covid-19. </center></blockquote></h3>
