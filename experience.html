	<blockquote><h3 p style="font-family: britannc bold; background-color: lightgrey; font-size: 20px; color: black;"><center>Experience refers to the fact or state of having been affected by or gained knowledge through direct observation or participation. As for me, I would like to share about my experience in my part time job. Usually, whenever I'm in semester break, I will find part time job so that I can have more money to spend and use in the next semester. It's like a back up money. So far, I have three experience in working. First, in Cafe Hospital Ampang. I am the waiter where I get people's order and serve them. The most important thing that I have to keep in mind while working there is I have to make sure they are satisfied and happy with my service. Even though it can be tiring, I have to keep smiling and be friendly.</center></blockquote>

	<blockquote><h3 p style="font-family: britannic bold; background-color: lightgrey; font-size: 20px; color: black;"><center>Next, I also work at King's Bakery and my position is as a cashier and sales girl. I have a really great time while working there. The environment is so nice. I get to learn so many new things from there like how to manage receipt, check and key in the inventory and stock, fold plastic in proper, manage the cake and serve customer especially when we have to write name on top of the cake. I'm totally enjoying it.</center></h3></blockquote>

	<blockquote><h3 p style="font-family: britannic bold; background-color: lightgrey; font-size: 20px; color: black;"><center>Last but not least, I would like to share my experience as a Teega's dropship. Well, I start to join the family in 2022 where it actually for my assignment ENT. I have to sell something and create my business so I decided to pick Teega as I think this brand is the most suitable one. Starting at the lowest level, I start be their dropship first. In only a month, I get promoted to be their agent. I'm so proud of myself as I achieve that level. Indeed, it's not that easy to selling online and my target customer that day is only my university friends. Howeveer, as I keep promoting and give a tester in every snakcs by Tegga, I gain people's trust and attention. They like it and repurchase the snacks from me. To my suprised, Teega always have 15 lucky draw in every month and the first time I join their team, the winner will get gold coin from Habib Jewellery. I'm totally in shocked. I think it's really a good benefits that Teega's team provide.</center></h3></blockquote>
