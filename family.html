From the picture, you can see my father, my mother, my older sister and my niece. My father's name is Supri bin Muhammad Yusuf and my mother's name is Asmah binti Mohd Sam. I have an older sister named Nurul Fatiha. She's only two years older than me. In this 2023, she is 23 while I'm 21. We get along well with each other. My niece is Nurul Syafiqah. She comes from my step-sister. Ever since she was a baby, my mom take her to live with us. Therefore, I assume her as my younger sister even though I am the youngest in my family. My family is so precious to me but sadly, my father has died in 2021 because of Covid-19. I remember that hectic days when everything falls behind and I get emotional when thinking that we cannot see his funeral day because my mom and niece are both positive covid while me and my sister are in quarantine. It's been a hard days since he left us.</center></h3></blockquote>
